# Bubble_Sort
Before studying sorting algorithms, this was my solution to the problem.
When you research time complexity on bubble sort most websites will
show best time complexity at O(n^2), which is not true.
I know engineers and programmers like to use the worst case time complexity
as a standard. But if the list or array is already sorted the time complexity
is O(n). Studies have shown that most of the time a list or array should already
be sorted if a database or program is engineered correctly.
